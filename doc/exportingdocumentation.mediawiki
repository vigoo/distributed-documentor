= Exporting documentation =

The documentation can be exported any time to either ''HTML'' or ''CHM'' format. 

'''Note:''' Compiling CHM files requires the ''Microsoft HTML Help Workshop'' which only runs on ''Windows'' systems!

== Export to CHM ==
# Select the ''File'' menu, choose the ''Export...'' submenu and ''Export to CHM'' menu item. 
# Choose a '''target folder''' for the export. It will create many files for the CHM compiler.
# The output will be called '''project.chm''' in the target folder.

'''Note:''' It is OK to export over a previous export's results. The files will be overwritten. For the first time it is recommended to use an empty directory.

== Export to HTML ==
The process is the same as with ''CHM'' files. The generated files in this case are all part of the static web site, with the entry point '''index.html'''. 

The generated web site will have a ''table of contents'' frame on its left, with a CHM-like JavaScript tree.
