* Use the ''Add...'' button to add new images from any location.
* Use the ''Remove'' button to remove the selected image from the documentation. 
::  '''NOTE''': this won't remove the image links from the pages. They have to be updated manually.
* Hovering the mouse over an item displays a ''tooltip'' showing the image
* Drag'n'drop an item from the image manager to a page's source to automatically create an image reference.

'''NOTE''': once an image is added to the ''image manager'', it is copied into the documentation's folder. Updating the original image will not automatically affect the image in the documentation.
