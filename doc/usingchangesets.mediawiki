= Using change sets =

== What is a change set? ==
When working on a documentation with ''Distributed Documentor'', the changes made are automatically saved in every few second, so there is no need for manually saving files.

When a logical set of modifications have been completed, this set of changes can be committed as a '''change set'''. This is a ''named'' set of changes (modifications, adding or removing pages, images, etc.). 

[SynchronizingChanges Synchronization] with remote repositories is change set based. If the latest changes have not been committed as a change set yet, then they won't be uploaded to the remote repository.

It is possible to see the ''history'' of a documentation project (the list of change sets, who committed them and when, etc.)

'''Note:''' seeing the history is currently not available in the application only with external tools.

== Creating change sets ==
As soon as there are changes made to the documentation, a warning message appears on the ''toolbar'' of the application:

[[Image:Screen%20Shot%202012-03-03%20at%205.42.38%20PM.png]]

Press the '''Commit''' button to create a new change set!

This brings up the ''Commit changes'' dialog:

[[Image:Screen%20Shot%202012-03-03%20at%205.43.52%20PM.png]]

Describe the change in the text field, and optionally choose which modifications to be included in this change set. 

If every change was checked, after committing the changeset the ''toolbar'' message disappears and will only appear when new changes have been made.

'''Note:''' It is recommended to make synchronization when there are ''no uncommitted changes!''

== Reverting changes ==

When something goes wrong it is possible to revert partially or fully to the last committed state. To do this, click on the '''Revert''' button on the ''uncommitted changes toolbar'':

[[Image:Screen%20Shot%202012-03-03%20at%205.47.14%20PM.png]]

The checked modifications will be ''undone'' and reverted to the last committed state.
