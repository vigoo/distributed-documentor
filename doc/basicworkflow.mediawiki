This page summarizes the basic workflow of the application.

== Opening a documentation ==
The first step is to ''create'' or ''open'' a documentation, using the ''startup screen:''

# '''Create new''' asks for a new empty directory to put a documentation in. The initial documentation project will have a single page with the ''start'' identifier.
#  '''Open from local directory''' asks for a directory which was either created with the first button or was cloned with the third button. It opens shows the current state of the documentation, including uncommitted changes.
# '''Clone from remote repository''' is described on a [CloneRemoteRepo separate page]

== Downloading remote changes ==
When the documentation was previously cloned from a remote repository, and now opened its local directory, it is usually good to [SynchronizingChanges get the latest remote changes] before starting to create changes.

== Creating content ==

=== Opening and editing pages ===
Initially the ''start'' page is opened for editing. If there are already other pages in the documentation, it is possible to open them by double-clicking their node in the ''Table of contents'' panel.

Use the [MediaWikiSyntax MediaWiki syntax] when editing the page. A ''live preview'' shows what the final documentation will look like.

=== Creating new pages ===

[[Image:Screen%20Shot%202012-03-03%20at%206.03.03%20PM.png|right]]
The simplest way to create new pages is to reference them on another page (using the Wiki syntax). For example, typing 
<pre>[AnotherPage another page]</pre>
will automatically create a page with identifier ''AnotherPage''. Every time you refer to this identifier on other pages, it will mean the same page.

Doing this immediately creates a node of the new page in the ''Table of contents'' panel also. By default it is put into the special node '''Unorganized pages'''.

Another possibility is to add a new node to the TOC, and then connect it to a documentation file. This is described in the '''Organizing the TOC''' section below.

=== Removing page references ===
If a page is not referenced anymore in any of the other pages, '''and''' it is in the ''Unorganized pages'' tree node, then one of the following two options happen:
* If the page was not edited since it has been created, it will be completely removed
* If it was edited, it is moved to the ''Recycle bin'' node. 

=== Organizing the TOC ===
The ''Table of contents'' panel has the following functionalities:
* By ''triple-clicking'' a node, its title can be edited. The exported documentation will use these titles when displaying a table of contents.
* The '''Add''' button adds a new node to the tree. This node is not connected to a documentation page, it has categorization purposes.
* The '''Remove''' button removes the selected node. If the node is a ''page node'' and is referenced on any of the documentation pages, it will be put to the ''Unorganized pages'' node. If it is a ''page node'' but is not referenced anywhere else, and has edited content, it is put into the ''Recycle bin'' node. Otherwise it is simply removed from the tree.
* With the ''Up'', ''Down'', ''Left'' and ''Right'' buttons the selected node can be organized into any hierarchy.
* Double clicking a node which does not have a documentation page connected to it yet brings up the ''Create new page'' dialog:

=== Using with images ===
See [UsingImages Using images] page for details on how to add and include images into the documentation.

== Committing changes ==
After a logical set of modifications has been completed, the changes can be ''committed''. See [UsingChangesets Using changesets] page for more information.

== Uploading local changes ==
Finally, when at least one ''changeset'' has been created, it is possible to upload the changes to the ''remote repository''. For more information, check the [SynchronizingChanges Synchronizing changes] page.
