= Cloning remote repositories =

When a ''remote repository'' is already set up, it is possible to '''clone it''' to be able to add modifications on a different computer.

See [BasicWorkflow basic workflow] for more information.

== Clone a repository ==
Choose the third option on the ''startup screen''. This brings up the ''Clone remote repository'' dialog:

# Fill the remote repository's URL, and optionally a user name and password. 
# Choose a new, empty target folder where the cloned files will be placed.
# Click ''Clone'' to perform the action. The cloned repository will be opened immediately.

== Open a previously cloned repository ==
Next time use the second option: ''Open from local directory'' to work on the cloned repository. To synchronize changes with the remote repository, refer to [UsingChangesets using changesets] and [SynchronizingChanges synchronizing changes] sections.
