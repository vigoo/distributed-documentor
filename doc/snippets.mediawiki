= Using snippets =

== What snippets are? ==

Snippets are ''page fragments'' which can be edited as pages, and can be included into multiple real pages (or other snippets).

Snippets cannot be directly put into the TOC or referred with a link. They are always inserted into the pages where they are used.

== Creating and removing snippets ==
Snippets have an ID with the same rules as pages, but their lifecycle is more primitive. 

To '''add''' a new snippet, use the ''snippets panel'''s add button and specify a new ID for it.

The selected snippet can be '''removed''' with the remove button.

== Editing snippets ==
To edit a snippet, double click on its item in the ''snippet manager''. This opens the usual wiki page editor for the given snippet.

== Including snippets in pages ==

The syntax to include a snippet in a ''MediaWiki'' page is the following:

<pre>[Snippet:SnippetId]</pre>

The reference always have to lie alone in its own line, and be on the beginning of that line.

It is also possible to '''drag and drop''' a snippet from the ''snippet manager'' to the text editor.
