= Introduction to Distributed Documentor =

== Goals ==
''Distributed Documentor'' is a desktop application enabling its users to create software documentation using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language lightweight markup languages] in multiple geographical locations simultaneously, with the ability to correctly synchronize the changes made at these distinct locations.

The documentation can be [ExportingDocumentation exported] any time to set of help formats at any location.

== Supported markup languages ==
The current version supports only the [MediaWikiSyntax MediaWiki] markup language.

== Supported media formats ==

Every common image format is supported and can be [UsingImages inserted] to the documentation pages.

It is recommended to use
* PNG for screenshots
* JPEG for other images

== Supported version control systems ==

This software uses [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Mercurial] for storing and synchronizing the documentation repositories between its instances. The application hides this implementation detail and provides easy to use user interface for [UsingChangesets committing changes and synchronization] and [CloneRemoteRepo cloning remote repositories].

The following two tasks require external tools in the current version:

=== Installing Mercurial ===
The current version cannot install Mercurial so it is a prerequisite for running ''Distributed Documentor''. The applications [SettingsDialog settings dialog] can be used to set the path to the ''mercurial binary''.

=== Setting up remote access for the repositories ===
This version has no support for hosting the repositories to make them remotely accessible.
